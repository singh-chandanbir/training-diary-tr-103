Git behind the scenes
---------------------

Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your files and folders. It is a powerful tool that can help you manage your code more effectively. In this section, we will explore the basics of how git works internally.

Git Snapshots
-------------

A git snapshot is a point in time in the history of your code. It represents a specific version of your code, including all the files and folders that were present at that time. Each snapshot is identified by a unique hash code, which is a string of characters that represents the contents of the snapshot.

A snapshot is not an image, itâ€™s just a representation of the code at a specific point in time. Snapshot is a loose term that is used when git stores information about the code in a locally stored key-value based database. Everything is stored as an object and each object is identified by a unique hash code.

3 Musketeers of git
-------------------

The three musketeers of git are:

*   Commit Object
*   Tree Object
*   Blob Object

Commit Object
-------------

Each commit in the project is stored in `.git` folder in the form of a commit object. A commit object contains the following information:

*   Tree Object
*   Parent Commit Object
*   Author
*   Committer
*   Commit Message

Tree Object
-----------

Tree Object is a container for all the files and folders in the project. It contains the following information:

*   File Mode
*   File Name
*   File Hash
*   Parent Tree Object

Everything is stored as key-value pairs in the tree object. The key is the file name and the value is the file hash.

Blob Object
-----------

Blob Object is present in the tree object and contains the actual file content. This is the place where the file content is stored.

Helpfil commands
----------------

Here are some helpful commands that you can use to explore the git internals:

Terminal window

    git show -s --pretty=raw <commit-hash>

Grab tree id from the above command and use it in the following command to get the tree object:

Terminal window

    git ls-tree <tree-id>

Grab tree id from the above command and use it in the following command to get the blob object:

Terminal window

    git show <blob-id>

Grab tree id from the above command and use it in the following command to get the commit object:

Terminal window

    git cat-file -p <commit-id>
