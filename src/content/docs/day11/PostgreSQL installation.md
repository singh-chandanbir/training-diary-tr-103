PostgreSQL Setup
================

Introduction
------------

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system. It is a highly scalable, SQL-compliant database management system that is used to handle large workloads. PostgreSQL is a popular choice for many developers and organizations due to its robust features, extensibility, and reliability.

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of setting up PostgreSQL on your system. In this modern age, you can take advantage of Docker to easily set up and run PostgreSQL on your local machine. Docker is a platform that allows you to package, distribute, and run applications in containers. It provides a lightweight and efficient way to run applications in isolated environments. Docker is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a versatile tool for developers.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin, you will need to have the following prerequisites:

*   A system running Windows, macOS, or Linux
*   Docker installed on your system
*   Basic knowledge of using the command line

Once the docker is installed, you can verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal:

Terminal window

    docker --version

This command will display the version of Docker installed on your system.

Now that you have Docker installed, create a new directory for your PostgreSQL data. This directory will be used to store the data files for your PostgreSQL instance. I usually keep this directory in my project folder so that it is easy to manage.

Then, create a new file named `docker-compose.yml` in the same directory. This file will contain the configuration for your PostgreSQL container.

Insert the following content into the `docker-compose.yml` file:

    version: '3'services:  db:    image: postgres    restart: always    volumes:      - ./data/db:/var/lib/postgresql/data    ports:      - 5432:5432  # make sure you don't have another container running on 5432
        environment:      - POSTGRES_DB=chaiDB      - POSTGRES_USER=chaiaurcode      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=chaiaurcode
      adminer:    image: adminer    restart: always    ports:      - 8080:8080

In this configuration file, we define two services: `db` and `adminer`. The `db` service is responsible for running the PostgreSQL instance, while the `adminer` service is responsible for running the Adminer web interface. Adminer is a lightweight database management tool that allows you to interact with your databases through a web interface.

The `db` service uses the `postgres` image from the Docker Hub registry. We specify the volume mapping to store the data files in the `./data/db` directory. The `ports` section maps the container port `5432` to the host port `5432`, allowing you to access the PostgreSQL instance from your local machine.

We also set the environment variables `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` to configure the database name, username, and password, respectively.

The `adminer` service uses the `adminer` image from the Docker Hub registry. We map the container port `8080` to the host port `8080` to access the Adminer web interface.

Now that you have created the `docker-compose.yml` file, you can start the PostgreSQL container by running the following command in the terminal:

Terminal window

    docker-compose up -d

This command will download the necessary images and start the PostgreSQL and Adminer containers in the background. You can verify that the containers are running by executing the following command:

Terminal window

    docker ps

This command will display a list of running containers on your system. You should see the `db` and `adminer` containers listed in the output.

You can now access the Adminer web interface by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8080`. In the login page, enter the database name, username, and password that you specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file. You should now be able to interact with your PostgreSQL database through the Adminer web interface.

If you want to connect with database url, you can use the following url:

    postgresql://chaiaurcode:chaiaurcode@localhost:5432/chaiDB

Thatâ€™s it! You have successfully set up PostgreSQL using Docker on your system. You can now start developing applications that use PostgreSQL as the backend database.
